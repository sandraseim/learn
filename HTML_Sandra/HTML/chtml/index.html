<!-- The second homework is a continuation of HOMEWORK 1. Now that You have initial design, elements and styling, time to upgrade it:
1.	Style Your pages with bootstrap, so that it would be responsive and fluid, [3]
2.	Beautify your web pages by using bootstrap forms, cards, sliders [2]
3.	Add logic to Your code (Javascript):
a.	Prompt a message if user does not fill the form properly, prompt if submission was successful [0.5]
b.	When user clicks on specific product, create an overlay with detailed information about that product. If You are developing not a shop, think where You could create overlay. [0.5]
c.	Create collapsible divs and transitions: for example, make a div appear when user scrolls down (the content becomes visible only then), add information in such form, that user must click for that information to be visible. [1]
d.	Perform some action (DOM events) for 10 different events [1]
e.	Create functions and call them (for example calculate total price, send email, etc.)[1]
f.	Create and use objects to store information [1]
 -->


 <!--The third homework is in a way a continuation of HOMEWORK 2. Letâ€™s imagine that You have set up Your own database and web server, have several endpoints to fetch some data:
 1.	Create a new html page that will store the returned data or add a section  to an existing page to store the returned data. [1]
 2.	Make 2 different API calls (You can choose any that You desire, https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis )[1]
 a.	One call returns a list of objects.
 b.	Another call returns some specific result.
 3.	Parse the retrieved data.[2]
 4.	Add data to the page:
 a.	Dynamically generate the page contents with data from api;[4]
 b.	Use bootsrap or Your won styling for generated content;[2]
